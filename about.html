New:

I think I would take out the tattoo part and add it more something related to this project being inspirated in H.P lovecraft and the misterious middle east arabesque forms. The combination of this concepts has been observed and rotulated by some people as "dark lettering". 

The code make use of "pre-rendered" or "pre-drawn" images that are combined together trough a simple algorythm. It is also a study for me to understand the best way to work with pre-rendered images. I find this study interestind and valuable to teach me a couple of generative art concepts, same as general javascript / web development fundamentals.

The code was written in p5.js and the traits are drawn in photoshop with a drwaing pad.

There is a small chance to find a black and white toned image in the minting process (20% chance)



"Explore the mysterious world of Dark Lettering with the latest project by Myr, the "Grimoire of Shadowed Script". This study delves into the structure of Dark Lettering style in tattoos and proposes a generative way of creating variations of posters using a grid system and rules for weight and colo  r. The system not only combines forms but also randomizes them to add a unique touch to the final design. The project draws inspiration from medieval illustrations, which adds an element of gothic aesthetic to the project, along with tattoo artists such as "NEVERLAND BBK" and "Sergey Mordoc". The project also blends elements of gothic typography, Arabic drawings, and gothic structures with symbols such as triangles, diamonds, and pointed lines.

Unlock the secrets of the magic and discover the beauty of imperfections in sketches, while also incorporating the abstract and gothic/arabesque forms found in the Dark Lettering style. The final touch of pixel grain adds a beautiful and unique touch to the final design. The project uses hand-drawn artwork on top of a grid, which is then randomized using p5.js. Join Myr on this journey of discovery and unveil the hidden beauty of Dark Lettering through the art of randomization, medieval illustrations, and pixel grain."

Each work represents an unique arabesque relic 


It's worth to mention that i'm very attracted to this forms since I was a kid.
When my friends were playing pokemon with 12 years old i was the one playing Diablo II
