This project being inspirated in H.P lovecraft and the misterious middle east arabesque forms. The combination of this concepts has been observed and rotulated by some people as "dark lettering". 
The code make use of "pre-rendered" or "pre-drawn" images that are combined together trough a simple algorythm. It is also a study for me to understand the best way to work with pre-rendered images. I find this study interestind and valuable to teach me a couple of generative art concepts, same as general javascript / web development fundamentals.

The code was written in p5.js and the traits are drawn in photoshop with a drwaing pad.

There is a small chance to find a black and white toned image in the minting process (20% chance)
