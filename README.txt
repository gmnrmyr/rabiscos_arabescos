This project draws heavy inspiration from H.P Lovecraft and the mysterious Middle Eastern Arabesque forms. The fusion of these concepts has been observed and articulated by some as "dark lettering". 
The code employs "pre-rendered" or "pre-drawn" images, which are combined via a simple algorithm. This project is also a personal study to understand the best practices when working with pre-rendered images. I find this study intriguing and valuable as it aids in my understanding of various generative art concepts, as well as fundamental principles of JavaScript and web development.
The code was written in p5.js, and the traits were drawn in Photoshop using a drawing pad.
There's a small chance to discover a black and white toned image during the minting process.


// FUNCTIONALITY:
- Left click: Stop animation
- Right click: Resume animation
- Right click (while saving): Save image
To reset the animation to its initial state, please reload the page. You can right-click while it's loading if you're interested in seeing the first frame. I personally prefer to stop it after a few frames.
